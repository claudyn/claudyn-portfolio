no Amazon offer exists,Bose 901 Direct/Reflecting Speaker System - Walnut,"The introduction of the revolutionary Bose® 901® speakers in 1968 redefined the phrase high fidelity. For the first time, a speaker was capable of reproducing music with much of the impact, clarity and spaciousness of a live performance. Today's 901 speakers incorporate some 350 enhancements over the acclaimed original. 901 speakers work by reflecting most of the sound off walls and other flat surfaces, instead of aiming all the sound toward you, as conventional speakers do. With Direct/Reflecting® speaker technology, anything you listen to, from the latest DVD audio to your favorite vintage records, acquires lifelike realism, because the speakers reproduce the natural concert hall balance of direct and reflected sound. The result is what we call Stereo Everywhere® speaker performance, stereo performance that is clear and lifelike everywhere in the room, instead of in just one ""sweet spot."" You'll experience balanced sound throughout the listening environment, no matter where you sit or stand. Just as you enjoy beautiful music reproduction from these speakers, you can also experience thrilling home theater effects from your home theater components. These speakers are an appropriate choice for use with your surround sound receiver, and can be used in conjunction with other Bose home theater speaker options.",559303,B0006B5V6G,2
no Amazon offer exists,"GLS Audio Speaker Cable 1/4"" to 1/4"" - 12 AWG Professional Bass/Guitar Speaker Cable for Amp - Black, 6 Ft.","GLS Audio speaker cables are manufactured with the highest grade materials in the industry. The copper wire is rated in AWG spec which stands for ""American Wire Gauge"". The AWG rating was developed by the USA as a result of some wire manufacturers stating their wire was a certain spec when it really wasn't. You'll notice most imported wire and cable manufacturers will rate their wire in ""G"" or Gauge (not AWG). The ""G"" rating can be used for any wire size. For example: A 12G rated cable may only be equivalent to a 18AWG cable (or worse). There are no regulations or specifications on ""G"" rated cables. How can you determine if a ""G"" rated cable is the same spec as an AWG cable? Unfortunately, you can't unless you test the power loss per foot. Sometimes the weight may be an indicator. For example: GLS Audio 50ft 12AWG cables weigh about 4lbs whereas most of our competitors weigh about 2.5lbs. This may be a result of the copper wire gauge not being true AWG.",1042,B004Z2G2T2,2

Those methods include AC/DC adapter (optional), three AAA batteries (not included) and the built-in rechargeable Ni-MH battery which can be charged from the AC adapter, by hand cranking, by solar panel or even by a PC.

no Amazon offer exists,Eton FR300 Emergency Crank Radio (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Amazon.com

With a dependable hand-crank power generator that powers the unit's AM/FM/TV/Weather radio, built-in LED flashlight, cell phone charger and emergency siren, the lightweight and portable Etón FR300 is an excellent and economical choice for anyone in the market for a radio that can be relied on in emergencies or in environments where there are limited power sources.

If you want a water-resistant radio, check out the FR 400.

Power When You Need It
At the heart of all of Etón's emergency radios, including the FR300, is an internal generator that recharges the internal Ni-MH battery pack and powers the radio, siren, and light. Also, by plugging your cell phone into the jack on the back of the radio, you can use the crank to power your phone. In our test, after draining our cell phone of power, we recharged it using the FR300 enough to make a few calls. The rate of cell phone recharging will vary greatly depending on the cell phone and the state of its battery, but the FR300 can provide your compatible p! hone with power in a pinch.

Important Note: Until this year, Etón provided a package of several different cell phone adapter tips with every radio. In 2007, Etón began instead including a coupon for a free adapter for whatever phone you have. So, the first thing you want to do when you get the radio is fill out the card with your cell phone's make and model and send it in to make sure you have your adapter.
According to the product manual, to achieve 40 to 60 minutes of uninterrupted power to the radio, you must turn the crank at a rate of two revolutions per second for 90 seconds. In our test, after our initial 90 seconds of rigorous cranking, the FR300 powered right up and was still going strong with radio reception after an hour. At the hour mark, we briefly turned the flashlight on, and that too was at full force, with no perceivable drain on radio reception. In fact, the FR300 was still going strong over 75 minutes after we recharged t! he battery pack. The FR300 can also be powered via an AC adapt! er which , to our dismay, is not included, or from three AA batteries, also not included. The dynamo crank tucks itself nicely into the side of the radio and offers little resistance as you turn the handle. (Don't let the cranking requirements frighten you! While it's true that a full 90 seconds of turning the crank can be tiring and may not be for everyone, we were able to recharge the radio with less than a minute of cranking and achieved over 40 minutes of continuous power.)
Design and Controls
At slightly more than a pound in weight, and with dimensions of 6.5 x 6.00 x 2.5 inches (WxHxD), the FR300 is made to be tucked neatly into its handy nylon carrying case, and stored in an emergency box, or packed neatly for a camping trip. A white LED light is set on the front of the radio, just to the side of the analog tuner. The light is designed to help you down an unlit stairwell or enclosed hallway in a pinch, but it is not directed or strong enough to help you much in a pitch-black forest or other open area. The FR300 also includes a red flash! ing LED light that can be used as a distress signal. The radio and light can be operated simultaneously, though of course at the expense of power.

The FR300 includes a handy strap on the top of the radio for easy carrying, and the tuning and volume knobs are set to the side. The mechanical controls are extremely visible and easy to use. The volume control is a bit difficult to finesse, while the tuning knob, which features a smaller concentric fine-tuning control knob, is much easier. An earphone jack is set into the back, and the telescoping antenna tucks neatly behind the handle strap. The radio's 2.5-inch speaker is set directly in front and offers reasonable audio quality and surprising power for the radio's purpose. The tuner itself is self-illuminated, though in a darkened environment it is still difficult to pick out the bands.

Measuring just under an inch thick and weighing less than half a pound, the Panasonic SL-SV590W personal CD player is a great fit whether you're working out at the gym, commuting on the train, or listening at home in the bedroom. The cover boasts a sleek white finish that's complemented by the pair of matching headphones, which sport a white headband of their own. More significantly, the unit plays more than just prerecorded CDs, with compatibility for both CD-R/RW discs and compressed MP3 files burned onto a CD-R/RW. The expanded playback options give users access to far more of their digital music library each time they leave the house. Active users will also appreciate the anti-skip protection and its related backup memory function, which combine to ensure a disruption-free listening experience whether you're driving or jogging.
At the core of the SL-SV590W's audio performance is Panasonic's advanced D.sound technology, which comprises four main components: a digital amplifier that reduces distortion for a clearer overall sound; the bass-enhancing capacity of S-XBS super bass boost and the digital audio gain control; and an MP3 remastering function that restores much of the lost fidelity of compressed MP3 audio files. The system also kicks up the bass performance inside your headphones with its H.Bass technology, which reproduces the harmonic series of bass components that traditionally vanish within smaller speaker drivers. H.Bass gives the listener the sensation of a fuller bass sound even though it doesn't actually exist.
Another nice feature is the SL-SV590's digital FM tuner, which lets you catch your favorite music, NPR, or public radio stations. Add in the unit's extra-long playback times--which extend up to 75 hours for MP3s and 33 hours for CDs on just two AA alkaline batteries (not included)--and you have a great CD player for long road trips or marathon workouts.

With very few exceptions, HDMI cables are pretty much the same inside: four conventional twisted data pairs for video data and a few other conductors for low-speed data...and most HDMI cable, whatever the name printed on the jacket may be, is made in one of a handful of Chinese wire factories using simple, standard constructions.

Blue Jeans Cable is different. We have our bulk cable manufactured in the USA, not in China (only our connectorization is done in China), and we use patented Belden bonded-pair technology (in which the pairs are physically bonded, not merely twisted), normally seen only in the best high-grade data cabling, to give our HDMI cable the ultimate in impedance stability. This means better performance over distances where other HDMI cables can fail--and it shows in our HDMI ATC certifications. Series-FE 28 AWG HDMI Cable with Ethernet is certified for longer distances--15 feet at high speed and 25 at standard--than any other 28 AWG HDMI cable.

Support for Every HDMI Feature, Protocol, and Standard:

As a high-speed cable with Ethernet, the Series-FE is fully compliant with all HDMI versions, and will support any feature, protocol or standard on any HDMI compliant device, whether your gear was designed under HDMI 1.0, HDMI 2.0, or anything in between. This includes:

- Deep Color (10 bit, 12 bit, or 16 bit, or as they are sometimes referred to, 30 bit, 36 bit or 48 bit);

- xvYCC and other colorspaces;

- all sound formats including DTS-HD and TrueHD Dolby

-all resolutions including 4k x 2k, 3D, 1080p, etc.

-Audio Return Channel

-All framerates (e.g., 1080p/24, 1080p/60) (display refresh rates, such as 120Hz, 240Hz, 360Hz, etc., do not affect the signal in the cable; this cable, like all cables, is compatible with all refresh rates)",118551,B0026NYL90,2

MasterControl RF10 is IR & RF capable. No more pointing - changing the way a remote works. Includes DVD Guide for quick & easy setup. Preprogrammed and learning - guaranteed to work with all components. Fully backlit keypad. Controls up to 8 components. 24 macros. USE WITH OPTIONAL POWERBLASTER FOR RF CAPABILITY.


From the Manufacturer



This is what the MasterControl RF10 is all about: the RF10 is designed to operate up to 8 different AV components and is pre-programmed to operate virtually all brands of TV, VCR, DVD and CD players, cable set top boxes, satellite receivers, TiVo and other DVRs, audio components, tape decks, multimedia PCs, satellite radio, iPod, Xbox, lighting controls and other custom installation products. It also offers an impressive lineup of special features designed to provide you with many time-saving conveniences and enhance your overall entertainment experience.

Pre-programmed with thousands of AV component codes



The RF10 can ""learn"" commands from other remote controls so it will always be up-to-date. View larger


Pre-Programmed Codes
The RF10 is guaranteed to control all your components because of the extensive library of thousands of AV component codes pre-programmed into the remote.
Learning Capability
The RF10 can actually ""learn"" commands from other remote controls (old or new), one button at a time, so it will always be up-to-date and never become obsolete. The RF10 is the last remote you'll ever need.
MacroPower Single-Button Control
MacroPower is a unique feature that enables you to turn all of your components ON or OFF at the same time, simply with the press of one button. What would normally take multiple remotes and button pushes, the RF10 can accomplish with the press of one button. In addition to the Power ON or OFF buttons, any of the Component buttons can be set to be ""macro"" buttons.
SimpleSound Total Volume Control
SimpleSound is a dynamic feature that gives you total volume control over all the components in your system, even those without their own built-in volume control such as TiVo, DVD and VCR, thus saving you the hassle and inconvenience of constantly needing to switch between Component modes on the remote. With SimpleSound you can set the RF10's volume control buttons to always control the sound in your system, even when you 're in VCR or DVD mode, without switching back to AUDIO or TV. Even more exciting, SimpleSound has what is called a 'Punch Through' feature and is not limited strictly to volume control.
Fully Backlit Keypad
This makes the RF10 easy to use in the dark or in dim lighting conditions. Simply press the LIGHT button, conveniently located on the side of the remote, to backlight all the keypad buttons and the LCD screen. To turn off the backlight press the LIGHT button again, or just wait 10 seconds (the backlight automatically shuts itself off).

Sends RF (Radio Frequency) signals that pass through walls and floors


""Barrier-Free"" RF (Radio Frequency) Capability
Of all the RF10 features, this is probably the most exciting. When used in combination with the optional PowerBlaster [sold separately], the RF10 becomes an amazing remote control powerhouse that sends multi-directional RF (Radio Frequency) signals that pass through walls, doors and floors--both indoors and outdoors. This changes everything...it enables you to control components that are completely out-of-sight, up to 100' away. The PowerBlaster picks up the RF10's radio frequency signals from any direction, regardless of distance, so the RF10 doesn't need to be pointed directly at any component. Just imagine--no more pointing. Now you can close your entertainment center doors, hide your components, and still control them with ease. Control outdoor speakers on your patio. Control your components anywhere.

Hitting The Home Theater Sweet Spot
Onkyo has forged an iron-clad reputation for making high-quality home theater more affordable. Case in point: the HT-RC360, a versatile networking A/V receiver with a savvy selection of today’s most vital technologies. This receiver does more than just handle all your favorite disc-based movies, games, and music. Thanks to its network function, the HT-RC360 also lets you bring to your living room a range of audio content from the internet or your PC. Six HDMI® inputs—including one on the front panel—let you enjoy all the latest A/V formats: immersive 3D video; ultra-high resolution 4K video upscaling via Qdeo™ technology; lossless audio from Dolby and DTS; and expanded surround sound from Audyssey DSX™ and Dolby® Pro Logic® IIz. Further exploiting the versatility of HDMI, the HT-RC360 includes a new user-friendly GUI and on-screen display for easy adjustment of settings. Driving it all is a clean and powerful amplifier design based on Onkyo’s proprietary WRAT.
Network Capability Delivers Internet Radio and Network Audio Streaming via Ethernet
As one of Onkyo's new breed of receivers that can link directly to the internet or to your home PC via a local network, the HT-RC360 takes streaming audio and internet radio to a whole new level. MP3, WMA, WMA Lossless, FLAC, WAV, Ogg Vorbis, AAC, and LPCM audio files can now be played back through your main system with unprecedented power and fidelity. The HT-RC360 also brings to life a huge array of internet radio channels from vTuner, SIRIUS XM Internet Radio®, Mediafly, Pandora®, and Slacker™, plus on-demand music streaming from Napster and Rhapsody (availability depends on region). As well as being compatible with earlier platforms, the receiver is compatible with Microsoft's Windows® 7 platform, which includes the DLNA 1.5-specified ""Play To"" media-streaming feature. The HT-RC360's internet connectivity has the added benefit of making firmware updates simpler than ever.
Direct Digital Connection of iPod®/iPhone® via Front-Panel USB Port

The HT-RC360's front-panel USB port lets you access MP3, WMA, WMA Lossless, FLAC, WAV, Ogg Vorbis, and AAC audio files stored on a USB flash drive or iPod®/iPhone®. As the audio signals are transported in digital form, rather than analog, there is much less chance for signal degradation. End result: your music sounds cleaner and more faithful to the original. A further benefit of the USB input is that it lets you use the system's remote controller to play back audio files on the connected device.
The HT-RC360 also incorporates Onkyo's exclusive Advanced Music Optimizer to compensate for lost bit information and improve the quality of compressed audio signals.

End result: your music sounds cleaner and more faithful to the original.Wireless Ready: PC and Internet Audio Delivered Wirelessly to Your Main System About the size of a quarter, the UWF-1 connects to the USB port on compatible Onkyo A/V receivers and brings audio through your wireless router to your home entertainment system.
HDMI® Support for 3D Video and Audio Return Channel
The six HDMI inputs on the HT-RC360 let you simultaneously connect high-def sources such as a Blu-ray player, a gaming console, and a cable/satellite tuner. A single output then sends a pristine signal to your connected high resolution display. The HDMI implementation on this receiver supports both 3D video and an Audio Return Channel, along with numerous high resolution formats. 3D video brings exciting possibilities to home entertainment, with movie, game, and broadcast content on the increase and 3D-compatible TVs now on the market. Meanwhile, the Audio Return Channel allows audio content received directly by your HDTV's tuner to be sent ""upstream"" via HDMI to your A/V receiver, without the need for a separate S/PDIF audio cable.4K Upscaling and Processing with Marvell Qdeo™ Video Chip

The initial voltage level of a battery provides no indication of how long the battery will last or how much power it can deliver. Alkaline battery cells rapidly drop below 1.5V soon after they are put into use and the voltage continues to steadily decline over time.
Since alkaline cells are non-rechargeable, they must be discarded and then replaced. SANYO’s eneloop batteries deliver best-in-class Ni-MH high capacity power and are rechargeable up to 1500 times. Devices like cameras flash units and wireless game controllers can easily draw more than 1000mA of current; rapidly depleting alkaline batteries.
eneloop batteries maintain a consistently high voltage level keeping your devices operating for a longer period of time. When you use eneloop Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, you will realize that “1.2V” can indeed be better than “1.5V”. WHY ARE ALKALINE BATTERIES 1.5V?
Regular disposable AA and AAA batteries are considered Primary Cells, and are most widely recognized as conventional “alkaline” batteries. There are two electrodes inside each cell; one is made of Zinc, known as the anode (",558693,B004UAG77G,2

Panasonic's SL-SV550 makes it easy to enjoy music with the freedom that comes from MP3 CD playback, extended battery life, a built-in FM/AM radio, and high-powered anti-skip technology. The onboard digital synthesizer tuner stores 30 stations in memory (20 FM and 10 AM) and assures that stations stay put once they're selected. Panasonic's exclusive No-Skip technology helps prevent interruptions from jostling during active use. No Skip's unique construction uses rubber brushings to absorb shock, while an anti-skip mechanism and an anti-skip digital servo further prevent read errors; a 48-second memory reserve provides added back up.
Now, battery changes will be fewer and farther between thanks to Panasonic's PowerLast high-efficiency power system, which combines an efficient motor with low-load circuitry for playback time of up to 35 hours on two AA batteries (during MP3 playback). CD playback abilities include 24-track random-access programming; repeat and resume (which picks up where the unit left off when last stopped); and skip/search, and memory/recall.

Sony's slim-design WM-FX195 stereo cassette player is portable enough--and, at under half a pound with batteries--light enough to go anywhere you do. In addition to playing tapes, the Walkman offers FM stereo and wideband AM radio reception. An anti-rolling mechanism maintains low wow and flutter by steadying the tape when you're running or walking, and an FM local/distant (DX) switch improves reception of fuzzy stations.
The player's automatic volume limiter system (AVLS) maintains an even volume level, guarding against unintended level increases and evening the output of musical passages that vary widely in level. A switch adjusts the sound to accommodate metal-oxide tapes, and Mega Bass produces deep, rich bass tones.
Automatic shut-off (in playback mode) extends battery life and helps prevent both mechanical and tape wear by turning off unit at the end of each tape side. Finally, an anti-rolling mechanism maintains stable tape speed to minimize music-distorting ""wow and flutter"" while the player is in motion.
Supplied MDR-026 over-ear headphones offer wide dynamic range and clear sound, and the unit also comes with a belt clip. Two AA batteries provide up to 25 hours of continuous tape playback (maximum, using Sony Alkaline batteries), or up to 55 hours of FM radio reception. And in case you don't keep count of the hours, a handy LED battery indicator warns you when it's time to switch.

no Amazon offer exists,Yamaha YSP-4000BL Digital Sound Projector (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"From the Manufacturer

The new YSP-4000 Digital Sound Projector offers versatile new features such as, 1080p-compatible HDMI, analog video to HDMI digital video up-conversion, and component/composite inputs. Other features include: iPod and XM HD surround compatibility, built-in FM tuner, RS-232C for custom installation and a wide variety of beam settings, including My Surround Beam, for a true multi-channel surround sound experience from a single component.

Intellibeam positioning calibrates itself to deliver the best sound True Multi-Channel Surround Sound from All Sources, Including TV

As amazing as it seems, the YSP-4000 can actually deliver multi-channel sound that surrounds listeners the same way that sound from front, center and rear speakers does. DVD movies and other digital sources sound just the way they are supposed to. Dolby Pro Logic II is included, so even 2-channel TV sound can be heard in true multi-channel surround.

Powerful Built-In Digital Amplifier

The YSP-4000 has a powerful and efficient digital amplifier built in. It powers the 40 beam drivers at 2W each and the two woofers at 20W each, for a total of 120W of power. There is no need to purchase an additional amplifier or receiver.

Wide Variety of Beam Settings

The My Surround mode provides surround sound without reflecting the beams off the walls. It is handy for rooms where for some reason the walls can not be used well and delivers a good surround effect when listeners are close to the unit. My Surround uses a combination of DiMagic and Yamaha technology. The My Beam setting focuses the sound at a specific listening position, so even in noisysurroundings you can hear dialogue and other sounds clearly. Sonic sensor means that My Beam can be selected with the remote control from almost any angle. There are also five other selectable beam settings: 5 Beam, 3 Beam, 3 Beam + Stereo, and 2-channel Stereo and 5-channel Stereo that outputs stereo sources from all of the 5-channel beams, providing a more expansive sound field.

IntelliBeam Automated System Calibration

This Yamaha exclusive feature ensures optimum multi-channel sound reproduction with accurate image location. By monitoring and analyzing the sound with the microphone included with the YSP-4000, IntelliBeam automatically sets the best beam angles, while optimizing the level and frequency response of each beam. It also offers Direct Start function via remote unit. This makes initial setup both extremely simple and acoustically perfect.

Speaking of acoustically perfect, the YSP-4000 applies the sophisticated Digital Sound Projector technology to precisely control the orientation of the sound by focusing it through multiple beams. The center channel sound is heard directly, while sounds from other channels are heard after reflecting off walls. The result is true multi-channel surround sound that sounds just like a multi-speaker system  but without the need for extra speakers.

The YSP-4000 is an elegant statement of the latest technology Analog Video to HDMI Digital Video Upconverion

The YSP-4000 provides upconversion of video composite and component signals to HDMI. The signal can then be output via a single HDMI cable to a monitor for enjoying high-definition video quality. The output supports 1080p/24Hz and 60Hz video signals, so they can be throughput to a monitor for enjoying high definition video quality.

The YSP-4000 provides analog video-upscaling of composite 480i signals and of component 480i or 480p signals to HDMI 1080i/720p resolutions for optimal viewing on high-definition displays. It uses advanced processing including video encoding/decoding ICs from Analog Devices and a TBC (Time Base Corrector) to restore degraded video signals for totally distortion-free viewing.

no Amazon offer exists,Philips CDC735 5-CD Changer (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"Amazon.com

What should you expect from a five-disc CD changer priced under $100? Not much in the way of bells and whistles or extra features. Nevertheless, it's amazing that Philips has managed to pack so much reliable, basic performance into the CDC735 and still offer something in the way of extras. As advertised, this model will accept and play up to five CDs, letting you even change two of the discs without interrupting playback. You also get random play and programmability--up to 32 tracks.
While you don't get a digital output or a headphone jack, the CDC735 does come with a remote control that you can use to access discs and tracks and perform typical functions such as play and stop. The player-mounted remote sensor won't respond to remote commands that come from beyond its narrow 60-degree ""window."" This can pose a problem for users seated at an angle to the player's front panel.
For its part, the front-panel layout is clean and easy to use, but the build quality is flimsy. For example, when you push the Open/Close button, the tray takes its time opening, groaning as it goes. Disc change is slow but sure--the CDC735 still functions reliably.
The sound, while clear and clean, seemed to us somewhat lifeless and ""slow"" relative to high-end players. Given that superior-performing changers can be had for less than twice the price, we find it difficult to recommend the CDC735 as a main system CD player. However, if you're looking for a garage player or just multidisc convenience at an easy price, the CDC735 will keep the music coming for pocket change.
Pros:
Low price Good value for the money Lets you change discs without interrupting the disc in play Full-function remote control
Cons:
Flimsy construction Limited-range sensor window for remote control No headphone jack Slow, noisy changer mechanism

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex’s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.

The JamP3 holds only one hour of music and can't record directly from CDs, but we were still pleased with its performance. Its sound is clear and balanced; it's made of impact-resistant, hard, rounded plastic; and it's more stylish than many other music-playing toys for older kids. It even comes with earphones. Because of its shorter memory, however, music lovers will need to frequently reprogram it to have any kind of variety. That being said, it works just fine and, once set up, is quite reliable. Note: Very young kids might be confused with programming it, and older teens may prefer the memory and functionality of a more expensive MP3 player.

The proof is all about us. Our planet is ""going green."" And to help that cause, Fuji EnviroMAX™ batteries bring a long-overdue dimension of eco-responsibility to the replacement battery market - along with unsurpassed power and longevity! You truly get the best of both worlds with Fuji EnviroMAX - at no added cost. Independent tests show Fuji EnviroMAX batteries equal, and most often exceed the performance and longevity of equivalent major brands. But that's only part of the Fuji EnviroMAX story. The materials that make up a Fuji EnviroMAX battery are derived from the basic elements of the Earth. There is nothing inside a Fuji EnviroMAX battery that will harm the environment if it is disposed of through normal waste systems. A few reasons why are that Fuji EnviroMAX batteries contain no harmful mercury, cadmium - nor are they packaged with dangerous (and non-recyclable) PVC plastic. Instead, Fuji EnviroMAX batteries are made in some of the world's most eco-respectful battery plants, operating under some of the most strict standards of environmental responsibility. In fact, most of all resources used in the Fuji EnviroMAX manufacturing process are reused and recycled! What's more, Fuji EnviroMAX batteries are labeled and packaged with recycled paper and P.E.T. plastic. The result is batteries that meet a world standard for environmental responsibility and recyclable materials. And no other batteries are so respectful of our environment as Fuji EnviroMAX.


From the Manufacturer


Fuji EnviroMAX Batteries--Powerful, Green, Eco-Respectful At first glance, all batteries look the same. They're all the same size and they fit snugly into one of the many portable electronic devices that have become very common in our everyday lives. Most of us never even give a thought to how batteries are made or what harm they can do to our environment once they are discarded. But Fuji EnviroMAX has been dedicated to developing one of the most enviornmentally respectful batteries on the planet for twenty years.

 Fuji EnviroMAX is dedicated to setting environmental standards with the batteries they make. At one time, all batteries were made with mercury and cadmium, which are heavy metals. These heavy metals, along with other materials, have been proven to be harmful to the environment. Fuji Batteries decided they wanted to confront this environmental danger head-on, so they developed Fuji EnviroMAX to eliminate the use of materials like mercury and cadmium, which are hazardous to the environment.

 Today, Fuji EnviroMAX batteries are designed to be enviornmentally respectful.

These polymer fibers are more efficient at conducting light (information) giving Vodka Optilink greater resolution and improved tonality over every other optical cable we’ve tried! Vodka Optilink preserves TosLink's great strengths of vanishingly low noise and zero mechanical noise, but offers something other TosLink cables can't...dynamic range! Compared to standard TosLink cables, the Optilink is a revelation, with surprising transient performance and excellent dynamic gradations. Optilink even outperforms similarly priced coaxial digital cables, with a smoother, more natural tonal palette and surprisingly deep black backgrounds. Often maligned as a low-performance digital interface, Toslink actually offers state-of-the-art optical S/PDIF resolution. Additionally, Toslink provides several key advantages, such as galvanic isolation and electrical isolation. And Toslink prevents introduction of RF interference over cable. The primary source of distortion in a fiber-optic cable is corruption of timing information. Imperfections in the optical fiber scatter the light information, leading to sound with less clarity and a need for more error correction. The superior fiber and finely polished optical interface of AudioQuest fiber-optic cable avoids these problems.",274387,B0073ITZZ8,2

Spin your commercial CDs, your homemade music CDs of almost any stripe, or listen to the radio, TV, or weather-band transmissions with Sony's versatile, D-NF600 Walkman portable CD player. The player includes a complementary high-tech-looking carry case, which hooks right to your belt, and SonicStage software, which lets you take full advantage of ATRAC3plus (Sony's proprietary music-compression technology) when making custom MP3 CDs on your computer.
 Playback options include 32-track programming, repeat (track, disc, or program), random play, and--thanks to Sony's great work in DSP efficiency--more than 42 hours of ATRAC3plus CD or up to 50 hours of audio CD playback from 1 AA battery (not included). Affix the supplied clip-on-style remote to your bag or belt, or hold it in your hand.
 The D-NF600 offers a 4-line dot-matrix display, full ID3 tag recognition, and bookmark playback (which lets you program your favorite songs from multiple CDs and play them back at the touch of a button). Jog-dial navigation simplifies song access, and file-view image display lets you sort through your tracks by folder for easy access to your favorite songs or albums. CD Text support displays artist and title information with compatible commercial audio CDs, and the unit's 3-color playback-mode LEDs indicate whether you're in play, fast-forward, or rewind mode.
 ATRAC3plus is a high-quality audio-compression technology that reduces the size of digital audio files while preserving much of a track's original sound quality (similar in concept to MP3 or Dolby Digital sound formats). With ATRAC3plus, music can be burned and compressed at 132, 105, 66, 64, or even 48 kbps (kilobits per second), letting you select the right balance between fidelity and storage space (you'll get around 490 songs per disc at 48 kbps).
 Compatible with ID3 tagging and most CD burners, the SonicStage CD Simple Burner software transfers songs from CDs or MP3 music files from your PC's hard drive and burns them to recordable CDs using ATRAC3plus compression.
 The D-NF600 offers a whopping 51 station presets, which works out to 30 FM, 10 AM, 4 WB, and 7 TV stations so you're never far from your favorite channels. You can hook the player up with your home system through an optional analog stereo ""Y"" interconnect.
 Skip-Free G-Protection technology boosts the laser pickup's shock protection to minimize read errors that would otherwise interrupt your music, providing quick recovery from both horizontal and vertical shocks. The D-NF600's heat-resistant lid helps protect the player against high-temperature build up, especially when you're using it outdoors or in a vehicle.
 There's a built-in equalizer with 3 preset curves and 1 customizable setting. Sony's automatic volume limiter system (AVLS) conserves batteries--and guards your hearing--by capping your listening level at either of two settings. The player works with an optional AC/DC 4.5V power adapter (AC-E30HG or -E30A).

Hear music as it was intended. With up to 1TB1 of hard drive
space, support for DSD and the full range of Hi-Res file formats,
plus built-in Wi-Fi, transferring audio from your PC has never
been easier.

Technology

Hi-Res Music Playback

The HAP-Z1ES can decode the following file formats: DSD (DSF, DSDIFF), PCM (44.1k/48k/88.2k/96k/176.4k/192kHz・16/24/32bit) DSD (2.8/5.6MHz), WAV, AIFF, FLAC, ALAC, ATRAC Advanced Lossless, ATRAC, MP3, AAC, WMA music file playback.

1TB Hard Drive for
music playback

Store personal music of all formats for local music playback on the 1 terabyte1 hard drive. Hard Drive is expandable via USB external hard drives.

Analog FIR Filters

This digital-to-analog converter effectively reduces high-frequency noise in DSD signals. It features independent right and left channels, with four analog FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters per channel producing a combined one-clock delay. FIR filters are ideal for D/A conversion of DSD signals.



DSD Re-mastering Engine

This ideal D/A conversion system combines a high-performance DSP and FPGA (field programmable gate array) to convert all signals to 128 FS DSD signals. It was designed based on know-how garnered from Sony's direct 8-times oversampling and Extended SBM
(Super Bit Mapping) technology for professional recorders.



Digital Sound Enhancement Engine

Offers natural sound with a spacious feel by restoring high frequency sound and the tail shape of the waveform likely to be removed through the audio compression process.

Wi-Fi Built-in

Newly designed built-in Wi-Fi increasing whole-house coverage and signal strength. HAP-Z1ES is rigorously tested to ensure its Wi-Fi signal strength. This real world testing is to certify it will work under the most extreme conditions.

Additional Features

""HDD Audio Remote"" for iOS and Android phones and Tablets

A dedicated app to control your listening experience with the HAP-Z1ES. Create playlists, search stored music and full track control.

Expandable storage via USB

Fine details and textures appear in whatever you're watching, even in flat areas. Powered by Sony's advanced noise reduction algorithm, this technology boosts image clarity with heightened contrast and depth that you won't find on most televisions.

Two large-capacity separate twin transformers

For Analog and Digital circuits, big and powerful transformers are used individually. The transformers are treated with impregnation in a vacuum. In a power block, analog circuit and digital circuit are separated strictly. It can remove some adverse effect from digital noise.

Low-phase noise liquid crystal oscillator

The master clock acting as the performance standard for D/A conversion is vital to achieving high sound quality. In particular, sound quality is strongly impacted by phase noise. This unit employs a liquid crystal oscillator with extremely low phase noise to achieve an ultra-clear sound field.

Music transfer software

Compatible with both Windows and Mac computers, this simple music transfer software allows you to select your music folder and sync it with the HAP-Z1ES.

The ES Frame and Beam chassis

The FB chassis, composed of a frame and beams, has a long and cherished tradition in the Sony ES Series. It offers both high-precision mounting of parts and high rigidity, achieving a high-fidelity sound field carrying large amounts of information. Notably, the base is composed of two plates of differing thickness that provide sturdy support for the chassis. There are two additional base plates beneath the transformers as well, offering robust reinforcement that anchors the transformers firmly in place.

no Amazon offer exists,Bose Acoustimass 5 Home Entertainment Speaker System (White),"Product Description


A revolution in speaker design and thinking was launched with this speaker system from Bose. The two satellite speakers are so tiny they fit in the palm of your hand. Perfect for any room in your house! They may be small but will still provide the famous Bose Direct-Reflecting M-^Y sound. The Bass Module will fill your room with deep, rich bass, while staying out of sight. Invisible sound! <b>Color: White</b>


Amazon.com



Experience enhanced sound from Bose's most affordable, next-generation Acoustimass stereo speakers. The Acoustimass 5 system in white delivers bass that's the deepest and fullest yet. Two single-cube speakers--smaller than ever before--are elegantly designed to fit virtually any decor. And the module easily hides away behind furniture or off in a corner, so all the lifelike sound seems to flow from the tiny cubes.



 

When you hear the Acoustimass 5 Series III speakers, you'll think you're listening to much larger speakers. Yet the spacious sound actually comes from two tiny cube speaker arrays and a hideaway Acoustimass bass module. The improved cube speakers offer enhanced performance, contemporary styling, and a smaller size than the Series II. And the improved module fills a room with even deeper, fuller bass. These Virtually Invisible speakers are the definitive answer to the question of how to combine spacious sound with space-saving design.
Though the Virtually Invisible speaker design may seem like a disappearing act, the performance is quite noticeable. Full, resonating bass and crystal-clear highs envelop a room in beautiful stereo sound. It's all the result of years of intense research and testing. The Acoustimass 5 speakers accomplish what no conventional speakers can claim: big, lifelike sound without big, bulky speakers. Now or in the future, Acoustimass stereo speakers can be turned into a home theater set by simply adding the compatible Bose VCS-10 center-channel speaker. For full five-speaker surround sound, add the VCS-30 center-surround speaker package. 
Key Features

Direct/Reflecting speaker technology delivers lifelike spaciousness from a natural balance of reflected and direct sound--similar to a live performance. 
Magnetically shielded speakers allow for speaker placement in close proximity to your TV without interfering with the picture quality. 
Automatic protection circuitry prevents drivers from being overdriven and provides increased reliability while minimizing interference with the listening experience. 
Syncom computer tested to ensure one of the highest levels of quality and reliability in the audio industry.

Amazon offer is in stock and shippable,"Yamaha NS-AW150BL 2-Way Indoor/Outdoor Speakers (Pair, Black) - Wired","Yamaha's compact NS-AW150 bookshelf speakers provide an affordable way to enjoy your music or television programming on a deck or under a porch. You can bring them in during the cold months and set them up indoors, too: their high build quality and good sound lend them equally well to two-channel indoor listening. The speakers, which are sold as a pair, each use a 5-inch high-compliance, polypropylene, mica-filled woofer and 5-inch PEI dome tweeter. The drivers are optimized for high rigidity but low mass, giving them reasonably high sensitivity (80 dB with 2.83V at 1 meter), another way of saying modest amplifiers won't have much trouble driving them. Their acoustic-suspension cabinets are sealed to prevent undue resonance or tubby, tuneless bass, which often results from low-cost ported designs. With a nominal impedance of 6 ohms, the speakers will work nicely with amplifiers up to 35 watts per channel, nominal, or 120 watts, peak power. They boast a frequency response of 80 to 40,000 Hz (+/-3 dB), giving you decent bass output for their compact size and unusually extended high-frequency response for your most demanding digital media. For indoor use, you may want to augment their performance with a subwoofer to deliver deeper and more powerful bass; be sure to select one with a variable crossover so you can tailor its upper frequency to effectively ""take over"" at the point of the NS-AW150s' lowest deliverable frequency. The speakers are magnetically shielded, so you can place them on or near a TV or video monitor without fear of picture degradation from their magnetic fields. Five-way binding posts simplify connection with several different terminations of speaker cable (including banana plugs), and the NS-AW150s even come with two lengths of cable to get you started. While you wouldn't want to leave the speakers exposed on, say, the deck of a boat, they are water resistant and designed to withstand light wind and rain--a benefit of their sealed enclosures and rugged metal grilles. The speakers come with mounting bases and brackets. What's in the Box: Two speakers, two lengths of speaker cable, speaker bases, mounting brackets, a warranty card, and a user's manual.",29803,B0001VGFKW,2

The unit's digital volume adjustment allows for precise tuning while its two-position volume limiter system maintains the volume at levels below the distortion threshold so listeners can enjoy cleaner sound reproduction. The D-EJ109 runs for approximately 50 hours on a pair of AA batteries, and includes an automatic shutoff feature that preserves battery life when the player is not in use.

The Heart of the Receptor: BassTrac Technology
 At the heart of the MicroSystem is Boston Acoustic's BassTrac technology, a proprietary Boston-designed circuit that tracks low frequencies and prevents audible amplifier distortion. Unlike conventional ""limiters,"" BassTrac doesn't merely chop off the tops of the distortion-inducing signal peaks. Instead, it actually preserves the waveform's shape so the fidelity of the signal is maintained, while preventing distortion.
 For those of us who can't explain the difference between AM and FM to a room full of first graders, this basically means that the MicroSystem is designed to give you all the bass without any of the distortion. The result is a full, pleasing broadcast at any volume for any type of music. When combined with the system's dual speakers, BassTrac circuitry provides such astonishing bass response that your friends will be convinced you have a subwoofer hidden in the room. In other words, the MicroSystem will give you a rich and smooth sound, whether you're cooking to fusion jazz or heavy metal, or waking up to the traffic report.
 Elegance, Performance and Convenience The MicroSystem CD is designed to take tabletop performance to the next level. Featuring a slot-loading CD player, AM/FM tuner, and remote control, the MicroSystem offers CD, MP3,WMA, and CD-R playback",885408,B00078F226,2

The Timex Story

Timex Group B.V. is one of the best-known American watch companies. Timex's U.S. headquarters are located in Middlebury Connecticut and it has substantial operations in China, the Philippines and India and full scale sales companies in Canada, the UK, France and Mexico.
The company began in 1854 as Waterbury Clock in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, known during the nineteenth century as the ""Switzerland of America."" Sister company Waterbury Watch manufactured the first inexpensive mechanical pocket watch in 1880. During World War I, Waterbury began making wristwatches, which had only just become popular, and in 1933 it made history by creating the first Mickey Mouse clock under license from Walt Disney, with Mickey's hands pointing the time.
During World War II, Waterbury renamed itself U.S. Time Company. In 1950 the company introduced a wristwatch called the Timex. Over the next three decades, Timex was sold through a series of advertisements which emphasized its durability by putting the watch through ""torture tests,"" such as falling over the Grand Coulee Dam or being strapped to the propeller of an outboard motor, with the slogan ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."" With the help of former Olympic broadcaster, spokesman John Cameron Swayze, sales took off. The company later became Timex Corporation, then Timex Group and, to date, has sold over one billion watches.
The company has remained very competitive and the Timex brand continues its dominance through present day. Its primary market remains the United States and Canada, although the Timex brand is sold worldwide due to its ability to capitalize on its strong brand image and reputation for quality.
One of the most successful and important features available on many Timex watches is the Indiglo backlight system. Indiglo is a brand name of Indiglo Corporation, solely owned by Timex for licensing purposes. Timex electroluminescent lamps, branded Indiglo, were introduced in 1992 in the Ironman watch line. They were an immediate success. The Indiglo lamp uniformly lights the surface of the Timex’s watch dials in a manner that makes the dial read very easily in many different light settings. In some newer watches the Indiglo backlight only lights up the numbers, rather than the entire LCD display, which is achieved by means of a specialized film that inverts the LCD transmissivity.
Today, Timex Group products are manufactured in the Far East and in Switzerland often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. With a large and varied line of watches, Timex has the style for everyone. From the locker room to the board room, there is a great Timex style time-piece for you.",40912,B00EB20A1C,2

# Claudyn's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page! 

Here you will find a collection of my university and personal projects that I have worked on, ranging from small personal projects to more complex team-based university projects. Through these projects, I have gained experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Each project on this page is accompanied by a brief  description of the project and the specific skills that I have acquired from it.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! :)

## SQL
I began this project by creating both a conceptual and logical data model. Following these data models, I used MySQL to implement a relational database and create the necessary tables. Data was then imported into the newly created tables. Using this database, I executed a series of SQL queries to extract specific data.

This project provided me with valuable experience and skills in database design, database management, and SQL.

## Tableau
In this project, I worked with a real-world dataset on property prices in Melbourne, Australia. After performing data cleaning on this complex dataset, I put together a data-storytelling presentation to an audience comprising individuals and corporates who are interested to invest in properties in Melbourne, mainly advising them if they should buy a 2-bedroom apartment in Northcote. I provided recommendations and insights that were backed by data, and used Tableau for creating all visualizations. Below is an example of an insight that was derived from the data.

This project equipped me with important skills in data cleaning and preparation, data analysis and interpretation, and data visualization using Tableau. Additionally, I learnt how to communicate data-driven insights effectively to different types of audiences. From this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation and interest for deriving insights from complex datasets in order to drive effective decision-making.

## NLP
This project involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information from text data.

From this project, I gained a better understanding of NLP techniques, text analysis and information extraction.

## ML-classification-models
For this project, I developed several machine learning classification models and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model. To begin, I preprocessed the training data to prepare it for training and testing. The classification models I developed and tuned include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost, and Gradient Boosting. To compare their performance, I evaluated the models using various metrics such as F1 Score, Precision and Recall. Finally, I selected the best-performing model to predict test data.

Through this project, I acquired a strong understanding of machine learning concepts, as well as the ability to preprocess data, develop classification models, perform hyperparameter optimization, and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## dog-breeds-website
This is a personal project that I undertook to gain a better understanding of web design and front-end web development. Having the freedom to develop a website on any topic under the sun, I decided to focus on DOGS - my favourite animals! In this project, I designed and created 6 different webpages using CSS and HTML. I have included a screenshot to one of the webpages below; screenshots of all 6 webpages can also be found in the "dog-breeds-website" file.

By completing this project, I acquired valuable skills in web design and front-end web development, including proficiency in CSS and HTML.

## Upcoming Projects!
In addition, I am currently working on 2 more machine learning projects that involve utilizing real-world datasets. 

1. Developing a machine learning classification model to assist hotels in predicting their bookings, with the aim of optimizing their overbooking strategy. 
2. Utilizing machine learning to predict HDB resale prices in Singapore, and identifying the key factors that influence these prices.

I will incorporate these projects into my portfolio once they are completed!

# Claudyn's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page! 

Here you will find a collection of my university and personal projects that I have worked on, ranging from small personal projects to more complex team-based university projects. Through these projects, I have gained experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Each project on this page is accompanied by a brief  description of the project and the specific skills that I have acquired from it.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! :)

## ML-classification-models
In this project, I developed several machine learning classification models and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model. Before that, I first preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for training and testing. The various classification models I developed and tuned include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost, and Gradient Boosting. Next, I evaluated and compared the performance of the models by using metrics such as F1 Score, Precision and Recall. Lastly, the best-performing model was chosen to predict test data.

# Claudyn's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page! 

Here you will find a collection of my university and personal projects that I have worked on, ranging from small personal projects to more complex team-based university projects. Through these projects, I have gained experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Each project on this page is accompanied by a brief  description of the project and the specific skills that I have acquired from it. 

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! :)

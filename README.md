# Claudyn's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio page! 

Here you will find a collection of my university and personal projects that I have worked on, ranging from small personal projects to more complex team-based university projects. Through these projects, I have gained experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Each project on this page is accompanied by a brief  description of the project and the specific skills that I have acquired from it.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! :)

## ML-classification-models
For this project, I developed several machine learning classification models and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model. To begin, I preprocessed the training data to prepare it for training and testing. The classification models I developed and tuned include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Adaboost, and Gradient Boosting. To compare their performance, I evaluated the models using various metrics such as F1 Score, Precision and Recall. Finally, I selected the best-performing model to predict test data.

Through this project, I acquired a strong understanding of machine learning concepts, as well as the ability to preprocess data, develop classification models, perform hyperparameter optimization, and evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## dog-breeds-website
This is a personal project that I undertook to explore and gain a better understanding of web design and front-end wed development. Having the freedom to develop a website on any topic under the sun, I decided to focus on DOGS - my favourite animals! Through this project, I designed and created 6 different webpages using CSS and HTML. Screenshots of these webpages can also be found in the "dog-breeds-website" file.

By completing this project, I acquired valuable skills in web design and front-end web development, including proficiency in CSS and HTML.
